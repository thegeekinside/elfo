 ========================
 
 The End of Line FOrmatter (elfo), is a little program intended to convert the
 EOL from DOS to unix and viceversa, is a dos2unix/unix2dos but in a single 
 tool.
 
 Compile and Install
 -------------------
 I use autotools for the development process and for package the program, then 
 for compile and install is very easy, follow the old rite:
 
 1) Unpack the tarball 
    tar -xzvf elfo-X.X.X.tar.gz
 2) cd elfo-X.X.X
 3) ./configure
 4) make
 5) sudo make install
 
 This install the tool in /usr/local/bin, if you want install in another place 
 use the --prefix option when you configure the package.
 
 You can compile the package in a windows environment with MingW32, any way 
 there are a binary distribution for windows in the site.
 
 Usage
 -----
 This program support short and long options to fomat the files, here is some 
 usage examples:
 
 To convert a unix file to DOS EOL format type the next line:

 elfo --t=dos --file=UnixFile
 
 Another way to done this because the format to convert is DOS by default, it 
 would be:
 
 elfo --file=UnixFile
 
 To convert a DOS file to unix EOL format type the next line:

 elfo --t=unix --file=DOSFile
